Observations:

1. need to have a mongodb database - server
2. install mongod
3. mongod should be running in the background

4. write a js code called server.js
5. server.js connects to mongo database using mongo's local url address 
(const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/x-clone';)
6. when running the app in development server you do "npm start" to run the client side
and "node server.js" to run the server side
7. node server.js runs the server.js file which connects to the mongodb and allows
the app to make changes to the db and access it. (server runs on port 3001)
(client runs on port 3000)

8. you can create a model in the database for use (model is user to store user data)
9. make changes to the db collection when registering
